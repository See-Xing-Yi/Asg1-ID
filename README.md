There are five main pages, one for a brief view of the game, the home page, one for the two characters, one for the story, one for the two endings you can reach in the game and a gallery for most of the CGS (or cutscenes) found in game.

#Design Process

The website is for people who are looking to read up on the whole game (albeit with lots of spoilers...) similar to a Fandom page, it is just a nice site for the fans of this game and community. They can also come to the page if they are here to find the cutscenes used in game and download them if they want.

2. Story, Endings Pages
  - These are written text for people to read up about the game and it's content
