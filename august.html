  <h3>Personality</h3>
  <p>At the onset of the game, Augustine grapples with self-doubt concerning his friendship with Winnie, particularly stemming from a prolonged hiatus in their connection following the incident where Winnie broke his leg. In his childhood, Augustine exuded brightness and cheerfulness, marked by a straightforward expression of his opinions about people. Notably, he insulted Winnie during their initial meeting as children, expressing a preference for forming friendships on his own terms rather than being coerced by parental influence.</p>
  <p>
  <p>As Augustine matures, a discernible shift occurs, revealing a more embittered attitude toward Winnie. He approaches the situation with heightened seriousness, prone to abrupt outbursts of yelling and possessing a distinct sense of reality that differs from Winnie's perspective. Augustine displays moments of coldness, acts with occasional paranoia concerning Winnie's opinion of him, and experiences vivid hallucinations, particularly envisioning Winnie as hostile—a likely manifestation of his concealed animosity. Overall, Augustine emerges as the more somber of the two, driven by insecurities and a relentless quest for answers.</p>
  <p>

  <!--Relations-->
  <h3>Relations with Winnie</h3>
  <p>Their relationship started in their childhood, when Augustine gets asked to be friends with him by Winnie's mother. They became close ever since, so much so everyone in their town knew that they were close.</p>
  <p>
  <p>However their relationship started to differ since their childhood when Winnie gets popular, Augustine starts to feel inferior next to Winnie, and starts to think that Winnie was stealing everything from him, his friends, hobbies, love interest, everything, and once in winter Winnie falls down the stairs, He doesn't save him nor calls for help, and instead leaves the building.</p>
  <p>
  <p>Their relationship in the game afterwards differs depending on the ending the user picks, push or don't push. In the bad ending, once he pushes Winnie down the stairs, killing him, not knowing that was the cause of his death, and he lives happily getting everything "Winnie stole from him", in the good ending, they face their issues, and Winnie stays a bit longer due to his move getting pushed back, but having to leave in the end, however even that Winnie isn't by his side anymore, Augustine knows that he wouldn't be alone. Because for the first time ever since they met, they became best friends.</p>
