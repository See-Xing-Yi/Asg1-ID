      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>
        At the onset of the game, Augustine grapples with self-doubt concerning
        his friendship with Winnie, particularly stemming from a prolonged
        hiatus in their connection following the incident where Winnie broke his
        leg. In his childhood, Augustine exuded brightness and cheerfulness,
        marked by a straightforward expression of his opinions about people.
        Notably, he insulted Winnie during their initial meeting as children,
        expressing a preference for forming friendships on his own terms rather
        than being coerced by parental influence.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        As Augustine matures, a discernible shift occurs, revealing a more
        embittered attitude toward Winnie. He approaches the situation with
        heightened seriousness, prone to abrupt outbursts of yelling and
        possessing a distinct sense of reality that differs from Winnie's
        perspective. Augustine displays moments of coldness, acts with
        occasional paranoia concerning Winnie's opinion of him, and experiences
        vivid hallucinations, particularly envisioning Winnie as hostile—a
        likely manifestation of his concealed animosity. Overall, Augustine
        emerges as the more somber of the two, driven by insecurities and a
        relentless quest for answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!--Relations-->
      </p>

      <h3>Relations with Winnie</h3>
      <p>
        Their relationship started in their childhood, when Augustine gets asked
        to be friends with him by Winnie's mother. They became close ever since,
        so much so everyone in their town knew that they were close.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        However their relationship started to differ since their childhood when
        Winnie gets popular, Augustine starts to feel inferior next to Winnie,
        and starts to think that Winnie was stealing everything from him, his
        friends, hobbies, love interest, everything, and once in winter Winnie
        falls down the stairs, He doesn't save him nor calls for help, and
        instead leaves the building.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Their relationship in the game afterwards differs depending on the
        ending the user picks, push or don't push. In the bad ending, once he
        pushes Winnie down the stairs, killing him, not knowing that was the
        cause of his death, and he lives happily getting everything "Winnie
        stole from him", in the good ending, they face their issues, and Winnie
        stays a bit longer due to his move getting pushed back, but having to
        leave in the end, however even that Winnie isn't by his side anymore,
        Augustine knows that he wouldn't be alone. Because for the first time
        ever since they met, they became best friends.
