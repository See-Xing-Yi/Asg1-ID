        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>
          At the onset of the game, Augustine grapples with self-doubt
          concerning his friendship with Winnie, particularly stemming from a
          prolonged hiatus in their connection following the incident where
          Winnie broke his leg. In his childhood, Augustine exuded brightness
          and cheerfulness, marked by a straightforward expression of his
          opinions about people. Notably, he insulted Winnie during their
          initial meeting as children, expressing a preference for forming
          friendships on his own terms rather than being coerced by parental
          influence.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Augustine matures, a discernible shift occurs, revealing a more
          embittered attitude toward Winnie. He approaches the situation with
          heightened seriousness, prone to abrupt outbursts of yelling and
          possessing a distinct sense of reality that differs from Winnie's
          perspective. Augustine displays moments of coldness, acts with
          occasional paranoia concerning Winnie's opinion of him, and
          experiences vivid hallucinations, particularly envisioning Winnie as
          hostile—a likely manifestation of his concealed animosity. Overall,
          Augustine emerges as the more somber of the two, driven by
          insecurities and a relentless quest for answers.
        </p>

        <h3>Relations with Winnie</h3>

        <p>
          Their relationship started in their childhood, when Augustine gets
          asked to be friends with him by Winnie's mother. They became close
          ever since, so much so everyone in their town knew that they were
          close.
        </p>

        <p>
          However their relationship started to differ since their childhood
          when Winnie gets popular, Augustine starts to feel inferior next to
          Winnie, and starts to think that Winnie was stealing everything from
          him, his friends, hobbies, love interest, everything, and once in
          winter Winnie falls down the stairs, He doesn't save him nor calls for
          help, and instead leaves the building.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their relationship in the game afterwards differs depending on the
          ending the user picks, push or don't push. In the bad ending, once he
          pushes Winnie down the stairs, killing him, not knowing that was the
          cause of his death, and he lives happily getting everything "Winnie
          stole from him", in the good ending, they face their issues, and
          Winnie stays a bit longer due to his move getting pushed back, but
          having to leave in the end, however even that Winnie isn't by his side
          anymore, Augustine knows that he wouldn't be alone. Because for the
          first time ever since they met, they became best friends.
