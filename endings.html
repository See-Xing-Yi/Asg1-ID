        Winnie snaps Augustine out of it and tells him that he had “a scary
        expression” and was sweating a lot, then a sudden talk about the first
        stairs incident goes and how Winnie knew that Augustine didn't push him,
        as he tripped himself, but if Augustine wanted to he could had saved him
        from falling, he stated that was when he seriously reflected on their
        relationship and why he distanced himseif from Augustine, with fear of
        destroying their relationship even more, however seeing how silence is
        ruining it more, Winnie places a hand on Augustine's shoulder and
        reassures him that he won't be mad or dissapointed, but to tell him
        everything, then everything that was bottling up starts to spill out.
        Reasonings, explanations and apologies were shared between the two, and
        like the first few cgs of the game, they share a fist bump, now then
        shifting topics from the coma dream, the elkbear, and how to get out of
        the dream, they realize the items they have in hand, a gas and a
        lighter. Now knowing what they will do, they went downstairs and waited
        til' the monster shows up, when it did, Winnie douses the monster with
        gas and Augustine lights it up on fire. They share a hug, but after not
        knowing what to do after this, they burn in the same fire that the
        abomination burned in.

        The tone of the scene here is blue, Augustine wakes up and shouts out
        Winnie's name. Seeing how Winnie is smiling, Augustine says how can he
        smile at a time like this, but Winnie says how Augustine is smiling
        aswell. In the hospital, it is stated that Winnie had minor injuries but
        was fine, on the other hand, Augustine broke his leg, due to the
        incident, Winnie's move was pushed farther, Winnie stayed by Augustine's
        side the entire time making sure he'll heal. Eventually, Winnie left.
        However despite that, it doesn't mean that Augustine will be alone.

        As Augustine pushes Winnie off the stairs, Winnie turns back to look at
        him for the last time. A marbled Augustine smiles for a brief moment
        before revealing Winnie's dead body. Augustine wakes up from the coma
        dream and refers to Winnie as "He" instead of his name, after seeing
        Winnie's body and seeing that he isn't breathing, he smiles. Back from
        the hospital, everyone starts to pay attention to him because Winnie is
        gone, despite it being implied to some that it was only out of pure
        pity, Augustine smiles again and says that he's finally not alone.
