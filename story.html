    <h3>Plot Outline</h3>
    <p>
        At an unspecified time where both Winnie and Augustine were children, Winnie relocated to the house adjacent to Augustine's residence on a chilly winter day. A few days after the move, Winnie's mother initiated a conversation with Augustine's mother. During their discussion, Winnie's mother noticed Augustine hiding behind his own mother. It was then suggested that Augustine approach Winnie, who had been avoiding interaction since his recent move. Initially resistant to open the door, Winnie eventually relented. Augustine approached a visibly upset Winnie, who expressed his distress over leaving all his friends behind at his previous home. Feeling alone and apprehensive about making new friends, Winnie opened up to Augustine. In response, Augustine encouraged him to persevere, maintain optimism, and work hard in life. Following their initial encounter, the two became inseparable, spending the majority of their time together over the years.

        As time progressed, it was revealed that during their last winter conversation, Winnie had fallen down a flight of stairs, breaking his leg. Winnie acknowledged that Augustine wasn't responsible for his fall, but he noted that Augustine was close enough to prevent it if he had chosen to intervene. Despite Augustine's departure from the scene, someone else had called for help for Winnie. This incident introduced the first strains in Winnie and Augustine's friendship. The two ceased communication for several months, with Winnie harboring paranoia that Augustine "hated" him, while Augustine remained unaware of Winnie's true sentiments.

        The next revelation was Winnie's impending move due to acceptance into the university they both applied to, a success Augustine did not share. Moreover, Winnie's parents' workplace was closer to the new location. During a brief car ride together, an argument ensued, leading them to be unexpectedly caught in a blizzard despite it being summer. This marks the commencement of the main events in Cold Front.
