        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>
          As a child, Winnie was shown to be incredibly shy, timid, and wary of
          others and their actions, particularly when a younger Augustine
          approached him. Nevertheless, with Augustine's words of encouragement,
          Winnie drew inspiration from Augustine's attitude, gradually adopting
          similar traits during his early years.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Winnie grew older, he displayed obvious similarities to the younger
          Augustine - bubbly, cheerful and optimistic. Winnie often approached
          situations with a lighthearted perspective, not taking them as
          seriously as Augustine did, as seen when he built a snowman during a
          blizzard while Augustine focused on looking for useful items in the
          car. Despite this carefree attitude, Winnie demonstrates a keen
          analytical ability, making deductions about their surroundings, such
          as sudden clothing changes and peculiar settings. Additionally, Winnie
          consistently prioritized Augustine's needs over his own, refusing to
          burden Augustine when offered to carry him due to Winnie being unable
          to handle the cold of the blizzard. As the narrative unfolds towards
          the conclusion in the good route, Winnie is shown to be very
          understanding of Augustine, and open minded to what he tells him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though not included in the game, the creator has stated that Winnie
          doesn't understand boundaries, he would make jokes or share
          information about Augustine that he would feel too personal about, he
          doesn't do it on purpose as he simply believe that is just what close
          friends do, not realising how he had hurt him.
        </p>

        <h3>Relations with Augustine</h3>
        <p>
          Winnie's relationship with Augustine began in childhood when Winnie,
          having recently moved into the house adjacent to Augustine's
          residence, faced the challenge of making new friends. Augustine's
          mother, noticing Winnie's hesitancy, suggested that Augustine approach
          him. Despite initial resistance, Winnie eventually opened up,
          expressing the difficulties of leaving friends behind during the move.
          Augustine in response, offered encouragement, fostering a friendship
          that became inseparable over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, their bond faced a strain when Winnie fell down a flight of
          stairs one winter, breaking his leg in the process. Winnie notes how
          he knew Augustine hadn't been the one who caused Winnie to fall down
          the stairs but at the time, Augustine was at a distance near Winnie
          where if Augustine wanted to, he would have been able to reach out and
          stop him from falling. It also turns out, that as Winnie was passing
          out from the fall, someone else had called for help for Winnie besides
          Augustine, as he had left the scene already. The two ceased
          communication for a long while, holding mutual misunderstandings as
          Winnie had thought Augustine hated him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later on, Augustine, plagued by severe insecurity and jealousy issues,
          particularly intensified when Winnie had gotten accepted into a
          university he also applied for but failed to get accepted into. As
          Winnie prepared to move away for university, he and Augustine opted to
          spend Winnie's last days together on a car ride to somewhere
          unspecified. However, an unexpected argument ensued due to Augustine's
          hallucinations of Winnie being extremely hostile, resulting in a car
          crash and the onset of shared flashbacks. These flashbacks represented
          their most significant memories—when they first met and when Winnie
          fell down the stairs. The two overcame adversity as they had a
          heartfelt conversation, Winnie was very understanding and forgiving
          towards Augustine. For the first time since their initial meeting,
          they had became best friends again. Eventually, Winnie left for
          university.
